If you want to execute delayed or scheduled payments in your app, you'll have to save client's card and you're at the right place! 

This module is here to complete the Stripe documentation and is providing you:
- card information saving
- delayed / scheduled payment
- notification by mail when delayed payment failed (3DS authentication asked another time, no cash available on client's account...)

You can use this module to learn how to implement the system in your app, or just to copy past it in your project to get something working directly. ¯&#92;&#95;(ツ)&#95;/¯

You'll find in the module: 
- Source code
- Documentation and Quickstart
- Integration of the payment system in your backend
- Stripe configurations
